/*
3. Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her first name and then last name, and
that then constructs, stores, and displays a third string, consisting of the user’s last name
followed by a comma, a space, and first name. Use char arrays and functions from the
cstring header file. A sample run could look like this:
Enter your first name: Flip
Enter your last name: Fleming
Here’s the information in a single string: Fleming, Flip
